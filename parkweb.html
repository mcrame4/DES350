	<p>Located in southern Oregon, this breath-taking park is waiting for you. It is the United State’s fifth oldest national park, established in 1902, and is actually the only national park in Oregon. The prominent lake takes form from the caldera left from the ancient Mount Mazama, an old volcano. The lake is approximately 5 by 6 miles across. It’s deepest point is 1,949 feet deep, making it the deepest lake in the United States. The park spans a total of 20.6 mi².</p>
	<p>
	In May 1902, Thedore Rosevelt established the park as a national park. The park was first established in May 1902 but has more history than that. Crater Lake began as a volcano. There are no streams or rivers running in or out of the lake. All of the water collected from precipitation. There is quite a bit of wildlife in the park. Mammals, birds and insects make up the largest portion of life. The most common sightings are ground squirrels, Canada Jays, and an assortment of butterflies and insects. The changing of seasons also plays an effect on the variety of wildlife, so come at different times of the year to get the full experience!
